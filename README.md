# AL: Artificial Logic
Mastering Automation with Wisdom, Precision, and a Backup Plan

## Introducing a New Era in Python Programming
AL (Artificial Logic) is a JupyterLab extension that combines AI intelligence with the pioneering spirit of Ada Lovelace. Create ultra-simple automations in JupyterLab with ease and efficiency.

## Core Philosophies: The Pillars of Progressive Code Development
AL's foundation rests on principles that ensure its position as both intuitive and sophisticated:

### 1. KISS - Keep It Simple, Stupid
AL structures automations within a limit of 15 steps per sequence, ensuring manageable workloads. This allows developers to focus on quality results without being overwhelmed by complexity.

### 2. Balance - Many Simple Steps Achieve Complicated Results
By balancing detailed, self-explanatory steps with adaptability, AL's approach to code ensures that even as specific use cases diverge from the main repository, they remain accessible through flexible dissemination channels like Git or instant messaging.

### 3. Layered Functionality: A Spectrum of Assistance
AL's novel interface is designed for versatility without complexity. 1st point and click automation and only then bells and whistles.

## Parts of AL
- **JupyterLab Copilot**: JupyterLab interface to Ollama assistants, with code isolation, context, and image descriptions.
- **JupyterLab Execution Watchdog**: AI cell runner that attempts to execute cells, asks an AI assistant to fix errors, and retries with corrected code.
- **Ollama Subrental**: Rent your Ollama server for AL usage.
- **Embedded Assistant for Versatile Platforms**: AI assistance tailored specifically for Unreal Editor and Blender via a tool-side Python server.

### 4. Customization: Crafting Your Code Companion
AL encourages users to take library solutions as starting points for customization. This process not only tailors functionality but also fosters community growth when successful adaptations become part of the main repository.
