# AL: Artificial Logic
Mastering Automation with Wisdom, Precision and a backup plan

## Introducing a New Era in Python Programming
Embrace **AL** (Artificial Logic), our JupyterLab extension that intertwines AI intelligence with the pioneering spirit of Ada Lovelace. 

## Core Philosophies: The Pillars of Progressive Code Development
AL's foundation rests on principles that assure its position as both intuitive and sophisticated - simplicity. 

### KISS - The Simplicity Paradigm for Complex Systems
The intelligent structuring of automations within AL — within a limit of 15 steps per sequence—ensures manageable workloads, making it easier for developers to focus on quality results without getting overwhelmed by complexity.

### Balance - many simple steps achive complicated results
By balancing detailed self-explanatory steps against a need for adaptability, AL's structural approach to code ensures that even as specific use cases diverge from the main repo, they remain accessible through flexible dissemination channels like git or IM.

### Layered Functionality: A Spectrum of Assistance
AL's interface is designed for versatility without complexity:
- **Jupyter-lab copilot** - Jupyter-lab interface to ollama assiants, with code isolation, context and image descriptions
- **Jupyter-lab execution Watchdog** - Jupyter-lab ai cell runner, will try to run cells, if it will find an error will ask an AI assitant to fix this, and will try again with fixed code.
- **Chat copilot** - Chat GPT like end software assistant. Web AI chat interface directly connected to Blender, Unreal Engine or...
- **Ollama subretal** - Rent Your Ollama server for AL useage.
- **Embedded Assistant for Versatile Platforms** - Harness AI assistance tailored specifically to Unreal Editor and Blender, toolside python server.

### Customization: Crafting Your Code Companion
The ethos of AL is grounded in practical application: users are encouraged to take library solutions as starting points for customization—a process that not only tailors functionality but also fosters community growth when successful adaptations become part of the main repo.
